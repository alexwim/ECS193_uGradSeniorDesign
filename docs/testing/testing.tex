\section{Summary}
Castle Defense aims to provide the user with a fun and enjoyable gaming experience for everyone. The game makes use of Virtual Reality and a Natural User Interface to provide this experience by using emerging technologies such as the Oculus Rift Dk2 and Leapmotion. Should any problems or questions arise, feel free to contact us at \url{castledefensegame@gmail.com}

		Class/Entity	
			&	Method	
			&	Assertion	
			&	Description\\
		\hline
		Castle			
			&	Init()	
			&	CurrentHealth == MaxHealth	
			&	Assert that the castle starts with max health.\\
		\hline
			&	LoseHealth()	
			&	CurrentHealth == (MaxHealth - \( \Delta \))	
			&	Assert that the castle's health depletes and depletes by a correct amount.\\

			&	GameOver()	
			&	CurrentHealth == 0 \newline
				GameOver.GUI == Activated	
			&	Assert that the castle health is depleted and that the end game GUI has activated.\\

		Enemy
			&	Init()
			&	CurrentHealth == MaxHealth \newline
				Target == Castle
			&	Assert that the enemy spawns with max health and that the enemy target is the player castle.\\

			&	LoseHealth()
			&	CurrentHealth == (MaxHealth - \( \Delta \))

				Verify(DeathAnimation).Called(1) \newline
				Verify(this).deleted \newline
			& Assert that the enemy health is 0. Assert that the enemy is no longer moving and that the death animation was called. Then assert that the enemy entity was deleted.\\

		Enemy Manager
			&	Spawn()		
			&	SpawnPoints[] != NULL \newline
				SpawnType != NULL \newline

\section{Non-Functional Testing}

\subsection{Security}

Not applicable. This product does not contain client sensitive data. The issue of potential hacks into the game is a considerable issue. All Unity games execute through the Unity platform similarly to how Java executes in the Java Virtual Machine. By default, there is ``natural" security through this platform. Therefore, if our game was to be compromised, then the issue persists to the entire Unity platform, which falls under the jurisdiction of the Unity Security Team.

\subsection{Fault Tolerance}

Not applicable. The game does not perform any form of persistence.

\subsection{Performance Testing}

Build and run the game. Use the frame-per-second (FPS) counter to poll an average FPS. An average FPS below 30 is unacceptable.
