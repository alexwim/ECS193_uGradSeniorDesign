\section{Game Installation}

No installation required. The Unity system behaves very similarly to Java. The Unity runtime environment acts like the Java Virtual Machine so installation of the game engine will suffice.

\section{Gameplay}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item First, make sure that both the Oculus Rift and the Leap Motion devices are on and connected to your computer.
	\item To run the game, start by executing \texttt{LeapVRCastleDefense\_DirectToRift.exe}.
	\item Put on the Oculus Rift.
	\item A game menu will appear. Move your hands in front of the Leap Motion device and press the \texttt{Start} button.
	\item Enemies will begin spawning. The enemies will constantly run towards the castle and attempt to damage it. 
	\item You, as the player, must defend your castle. To defend your castle, you can use your hands to pick up the enemies and toss them into the air. When they fall and hit the ground, they will receive damage. 
	\item Enemies can also spawn from any direction so you will need to rotate your head and/or body to constantly look around.
	\item When all enemies on the current level are defeated, a countdown is shown at the top. This is the countdown until the next wave of enemies spawn. 
	\item The game continues until player runs out of health.
\end{enumerate}
